## API Security ##
# 1. Authentication
# Implementation: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure password policies, JWT tokens with proper expiration, and session management.
# Security Features: Password hashing using bcrypt or similar algorithms, account lockout mechanisms after failed attempts, and secure password reset flows.
# 2. Authorization
# Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between guests, hosts, and administrators with appropriate permissions for each role.
# Security Features: API endpoint protection ensuring users can only access their own data, property ownership verification, and booking authorization checks.
# 3. Rate Limiting
# Implementation: API request throttling to prevent users from overwhelming the system with excessive requests and limiting denial of service threats Imperva IncSearch Security.
# Security Features: IP-based request limiting, user-based rate limits, and progressive delays for repeated violations.
# 4. Data Encryption
# Implementation: HTTPS/TLS encryption for all data transmission, database encryption for sensitive data at rest.
# Security Features: End-to-end encryption for payment information, encrypted storage of personal data, and secure API communication.
# 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
# Implementation: Server-side validation for all user inputs, SQL injection prevention, and XSS protection.
# Security Features: Parameter validation, file upload restrictions, and malicious payload detection.

# Why Security is Crucial for Each Key Area
# User Management Security
# Protecting user credentials and personal information is essential to prevent identity theft and unauthorized account access. A breach in user authentication could compromise the entire platform's integrity and user trust.
# Property Management Security
# Securing property listings prevents unauthorized modifications and ensures only legitimate hosts can manage their properties. This protects both property owners and potential guests from fraudulent listings.
# Booking System Security
# Booking security ensures reservation integrity and prevents double-bookings or unauthorized cancellations. This maintains the platform's reliability and protects both hosts' income and guests' travel plans.
# Payment Processing Security
# Payment security is critical for preventing financial fraud, protecting credit card information, and ensuring secure money transfers. 
# Review System Security
# Review security prevents fake reviews, review manipulation, and ensures authentic feedback. This maintains the platform's credibility and helps users make informed booking decisions.
# API Security
# API protection prevents unauthorized access to backend services and protects against common attacks like DDoS and brute force attempts. This ensures platform availability and data integrity across all features.

## CI/CD Pipeline ##
# A CI/CD pipeline is an automated workflow that takes code from development through testing, building, and deployment stages. It ensures that every code change is automatically tested, validated, and deployed consistently across different environments.
# Tools that can be use for CI/CD
# GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes

## Team Roles ##
# Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic. Implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.
# Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations. is an information technology professional responsible for the maintenance, security, performance, and integrity of an organization's databases.
# Devops Engineer: facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams, Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
# QA Engineer: designs a test automation ecosystem, Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing

## UI/UX Design Planning ##
# Color Styles:
# Primary: #FF5A5F #34967C
# Secondary: #008489 #FFA800
# Background: #FFFFFF
# Text: #222222 #FFFFFF #000000 #8F8F8F
# Secondary Text: #717171 
# Typography:
# Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
# Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
# Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px

# Importance of Identifying Design Properties from Mockup Designs
# Development Consistency
# Identifying specific design properties ensures all developers implement the exact same visual standards across different components and pages. This prevents inconsistencies where one developer might use #FF5A5F for buttons while another uses a similar but different shade, maintaining brand integrity throughout the platform.
# Efficient Workflow and Maintenance
# Having documented design properties allows developers to create reusable CSS variables or design tokens that can be easily updated globally. For example, if the brand color needs to change from #FF5A5F to a different shade, updating one variable changes it across all components rather than searching through hundreds of files.
# Designer-Developer Communication
# Clear documentation of typography and color specifications eliminates guesswork and reduces back-and-forth communication between designers and developers. Developers can confidently implement features knowing they're using the correct Circular font weights and exact color values.
# Scalability and Team Collaboration
# As the project grows and new team members join, having established design properties provides immediate guidance on how to maintain visual consistency. New developers can reference the documented styles rather than trying to reverse-engineer designs from existing components.
# User Experience Consistency
# Consistent application of these design properties creates a cohesive user experience where property cards, booking forms, and navigation elements all feel like part of the same platform, building user trust and professional credibility.
